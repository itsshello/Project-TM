# Project TM
A music player that includes all of the music you listen to or want to listen to.
<br>[Made for educational purposes]

# Note:
This project will continue to be updated until it's complete.<br>
This README may not be fully accurate at the moment, but it will be finalized upon project completion.<br>
The README currently skips instructions for installing `ffmpeg.exe`, which is required to install music. You can download `ffmpeg.exe` manually and place it in the `/bin` folder, or wait for future updates that will/should automate this process.<br>
